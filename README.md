## Overview
zk-scholar is a blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize scholarship distribution. By integrating AI-powered evaluation agents and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs), we ensure secure, transparent, and efficient scholarship fund allocation.

##Initialize the project
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Features
- **Identity Verification**: Students verify their identity using zk-anon Aadhaar, revealing only essential details (age, gender, state).
- **AI Evaluation**: AI agent **0xAgent** evaluates the studentâ€™s subject interest and knowledge through voice-based interactive tests.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Test results are stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and preventing multiple test attempts.
- **Smart Contracts**: Funds are allocated based on test scores and securely transferred to verified universities.

## How It Works
1. Students log in via zk-proofs and connect their wallets using MetaMask.
2. Select a university and course.
3. Take an AI-administered test evaluated by 0xAgent.
4. Scores are stored on-chain, and smart contracts allocate funds accordingly.
5. Universities verify scholarships and claim funds securely.
